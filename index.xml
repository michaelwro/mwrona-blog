      <description>One of the most important components in control systems for airplanes, fighter jets, quadcopters, and rockets is the AHRS, or Attitude and Heading Reference System. As you can guess, the AHRS tells a system it&amp;rsquo;s current attitude orientation and heading. Attitude measurements are typically given as roll and pitch angles, and heading is relative to either magnetic or true north.</description>

      <description>About six years ago, I purchased a Spektrum DX6i RC plane transmitter to fly my RC planes with. Unfortunately, life got busier and my interests shifted, which sent my planes and controller to retire in the basement. When the idea to build a quadcopter flight controller began to come to fruition, I knew my DX6i controller would be perfect!</description>

      <description>Ever since I was first introduced to the world of flight dynamics and controls, I have wanted to design my own quadcopter flight controller from scratch. I thought it would be a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of electronics and circuitry, programming, and flight controls towards a real-world project.</description>

      <description>If you want to get the biggest bang for your buck when building a PC, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to buy secondhand parts - there&amp;rsquo;s no denying it! Believe me, as someone whose net worth is defined primarily by electronics, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to squeeze as much value as possible out of your limited cash.</description>
