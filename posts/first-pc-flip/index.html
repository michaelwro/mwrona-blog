			<p>If you want to get the biggest bang for your buck when building a PC, you&rsquo;re going to have to buy secondhand parts - there&rsquo;s no denying it! Believe me, as someone whose net worth is defined primarily by electronics, you&rsquo;re going to want to squeeze as much value as possible out of your limited cash. Unfortunately, there seems to exist a bit of a stigma around buying used PC parts that prevents people from considering this option. I&rsquo;m here to advocate against this stigma, and to tell you that it is simply not true!</p>
<p>I believe that most PC parts are totally acceptable to purchase secondhand, with a few exeptions<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. These parts are made to last years with proper care and usage. Proper care means not allowing a half-inch of dust accumulate inside your PC and on top of components (dust = no airflow = heat = bad), and proper usage means not overclocking components. I would say a large majority of PC users follow these guidelines, which means most PC parts are still, functionally, in great condition.</p>

<h2 id="cpu-mobo-ram">CPU, Mobo, RAM</h2>
<p>I wanted to see how many good PC part deals I could find in the Ames and Des Moines, Iowa area and build, in my opinion, one of the best bang for your buck PCs - the &lsquo;Big Dealz&rsquo; PC! With my coffee within arms reach and a &lsquo;LoFi beats to Study To&rsquo; playlist playing, I began to scavenge the depths of Ebay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace for those sweet, sweet deals. The first parts to fall into my hands were a CPU, motherboard, and RAM that I got as a combo on Facebook Marketplace. The CPU was the tride-and-true Intel 4770, an LGA1150 4C/8T processor clocked at 3.4GHz. The motherboard was an MSI H81-P33 microATX board, which had &ldquo;Military Class 4&rdquo; on the box, which means it&rsquo;s a good one I guess. The RAM was a standard kit of Corsair Vengeance 2x8GB (16GB) DDR3 memory clocked at 1600MHz. All together, the CPU, motherboard, and RAM came to a total of \$190 USD. Not a bad start!</p>
<h2 id="cpu-cooler">CPU Cooler</h2>
<p>I went with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TUKLAHI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Thermaltake Frio Silent</a> CPU cooler for its relatively low price, good cooling performance, and low noise. I picked it up for \$25 on Amazon. I know this goes against the secondhand-only theme, but there weren&rsquo;t any good secondhand deals in my area :(</p>

<h2 id="gpu">GPU</h2>
<p>After a week or so of checking secondhand sites, I came across a great graphics card deal. It was a PNY XLR8 GTX 1060 GPU, which featured 3GB of video memory and <em>LED lights!</em> I managed to negotiate the price down to \$90, which was a really great deal for such a solid GPU.</p>
<h2 id="psu">PSU</h2>
<p>With the CPU, GPU, RAM, and motherboard - the most expensive parts - out of the way, I began to hunt around for a power supply. I found an older Antec 500W 80+ certified power supply for \$20 not too far from my apartment. My only criteria for the PSU were that it had to be &gt; 450W, had a PCIe power cable, and was in good contition. This one fit the bill just fine. I picked it up from a nice elderly lady, which wasn&rsquo;t too strange. What did catch me off-guard, however, was that she could answer my questions about computers fluently. I guess not all granneies are computer illiterate!</p>

<h2 id="storage-os">Storage, OS</h2>
<p>For storage, I picked up a Samsung 840 240GB SSD from my friend <a href="https://nathanv.me/">Nathan</a> for \$25. I had a Samsung 500GB hard drive laying around, which I figure was worth about \$20. Again, both pretty decent deals. For the operating system, I bought an OEM version of Windows 10 from <a href="https://www.kinguin.net/">Kinguin</a> for around \$14 and slapped it onto the SSD.</p>
<h2 id="case">Case</h2>
<p>Finally, for the case, I went with the <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bHm323/rosewill-fbm-x2-microatx-mini-tower-case-fbm-x2">Rosewill FMB-X2 uATX Mini Tower</a> case, which I picked up for \$35 online. Again, I know this goes against the secondhand parts only theme, but there weren&rsquo;t any good deals!</p>

<h2 id="problem-while-cleaning">Problem While Cleaning</h2>
<p>With all the parts in my posession, I began assembling the Big Dealz PC. Assembly went relatively smooth: the case had enough clearance to fit the CPU cooler and GPU, the motherboard fit fine, and it booted on the first try! Unfortunately, I did encounter one MAJOR problem. After completing the build, I began to wipe away fingerprints with 91% rubbing alcohol on a rag, which ended up being a HUGE mistake. I went to wipe down the front of the case, looked at my towel afterwards to see if there was any dirt, and realized it was jet black. I then frantically turned towards the PC case, and my heart dropped when I realized the entire front of the case had HUGE white streaks wherever I wiped with my rag. I guess the concentrated alcohol ate away at the cheap plastic and bleached the color or whatever coating the plastic had. I had the PC built and ready to go, but completely ruined the case. I then noticed that the streaks looked similar to white-bleached wood stain. Ah-ha, what a great observation that was! I decided that the best option to recover this case was to try and give it a wood texture. I diluted some rubbing alcohol with water and used paper towels to wipe the plastic front vertically. After a few rounds of brushing the case front with diluted rubbing alcohol, the result ended up looking halfway decent - a successful recovery!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>After using this computer for about a month, I can say that this was a really great all-around computer. I never noticed it being sluggish, navigating through files was snappy, internet browsing and video playback were seamless, and all engineering software I used ran great. I do not play any video games, so I unfortunately didn&rsquo;t test gaming performance.</p>
<p>I hope you found this build story interesting and useful. I would highly recommend building a similar computer if you are looking for a budget-friendly, reliable, and wholesome PC capable of office productivity work and light to moderate gaming.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the components I used in the PC along with a cost breakdown. Note that I built this PC in mid-2019. Many of the components were purchased secondhand. Retail prices may differ.</p>

<p>In my opinion, CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, SSDs, case fans, and cases are totally acceptable to purchase secondhand without worry. However, I would stay away from buying hard drives and liquid CPU coolers secondhand, as those are notorious for wearing out and causing catastrophic failure. You don&rsquo;t want to lose your data on a hard drive or have your CPU overheat! Power supplies can sometimes be a bit iffy, but I would generally trust them to function fine. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
