I have used VS Code extensively for about three years, during university, at work, and for my personal projects. I have a pretty diverse programming workflow - I develop C/C++ for numerical simulations and embedded devices, and use Python for scripting, plotting data, and everything else. I wanted to introduce my favorite VS Code extensions that I use daily as a professional engineer and tinkerer.

## C/C++ by Microsoft

If you do any C or C++ development in VS Code, you'd be an idiot not to download [Microsoft's C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools). Most notably, it adds syntax highlighting, debugging, and IntelliSense features. The IntelliSense feature really is a game-changer. This extension truly turns VS Code into a *proper* C and C++ IDE.
