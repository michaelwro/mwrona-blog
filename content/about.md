Michael Wrona is a recent Aerospace Engineering graduate from Iowa State University with interests in spaceflight, dynamics and control theory, electronics, and programming. During his undergraduate education, he completed two NASA internships, one at the NASA Langley Research Center and another at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in addition to a few undergraduate research assistantships. He is also a private pilot with ~80 hours logged between three aircraft.

His next step is to pursue graduate school and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering, focusing on orbital mechanics and control theory. He hopes to someday work for NASA as a GNC Engineer or Spacecraft Navigation Engineer.

In his free time, Michael enjoys cooking, playing his guitar, watching Netflix, reading sci-fi books, and tinkering with electronics.
