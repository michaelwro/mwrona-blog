      <title>Measuring IMU Noise Density</title>

      <description>Sensor noise is an extremely important characteristic to consider when integrating sensors into a project. Sensor noise distorts underlying signals engineers are interested in, which makes measuring underlying processes more difficult or near impossible. Since the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is such an important system in rockets, airplanes, and satellites, not fully understanding IMU noise can be disaterous!</description>

      <description>Rate gyros measure angular rotation rate, or angular velocity, in units of degrees per second [deg/s] or radians per second [rad/s]. Gyros are used across many diverse applications. Since I come from an aerospace background, I know that gyros are extremely important sensors in rockets, satellies, missiles, and airplane autopilots.</description>

      <description>One of the most important parts of any aerospace control system are the sensor fusion and state estimation algorithms. This software system is responsible for recording sensor observations and &amp;lsquo;fusing&amp;rsquo; measurements to estimate parameters such as orientation, position, and speed. The quality of sensor fusion algorithms will directly influence how well your control system will perform.</description>

      <title>Roll and Pitch Angles From Accelerometer Sensors</title>

      <description>One of the most important components in control systems for airplanes, fighter jets, quadcopters, and rockets is the AHRS, or Attitude and Heading Reference System. As you can guess, the AHRS tells a system its current attitude orientation and heading. Attitude measurements are typically given as roll and pitch angles, and heading is relative to either magnetic or true north.</description>

      <description>Ever since I was first introduced to the world of flight dynamics and controls, I have wanted to design my own quadcopter flight controller from scratch. I thought it would be a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of electronics and circuitry, programming, and flight controls towards a real-world project.</description>
