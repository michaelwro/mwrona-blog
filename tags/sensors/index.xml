      <description>One of the most important components in control systems for airplanes, fighter jets, quadcopters, and rockets is the AHRS, or Attitude and Heading Reference System. As you can guess, the AHRS tells a system its current attitude orientation and heading. Attitude measurements are typically given as roll and pitch angles, and heading is relative to either magnetic or true north.</description>

      <description>Ever since I was first introduced to the world of flight dynamics and controls, I have wanted to design my own quadcopter flight controller from scratch. I thought it would be a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of electronics and circuitry, programming, and flight controls towards a real-world project.</description>
