      <description>One of the most important parts of any aerospace control system are the sensor fusion and state estimation algorithms. This software system is responsible for recording sensor observations and &amp;lsquo;fusing&amp;rsquo; measurements to estimate parameters such as orientation, position, and speed. The quality of sensor fusion algorithms will directly influence how well your control system will perform.</description>

      <description>One of the most important components in control systems for airplanes, fighter jets, quadcopters, and rockets is the AHRS, or Attitude and Heading Reference System. As you can guess, the AHRS tells a system its current attitude orientation and heading. Attitude measurements are typically given as roll and pitch angles, and heading is relative to either magnetic or true north.</description>
